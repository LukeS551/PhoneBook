## Phonebook App

I will start by acknowledging we both know this is built heavily using generated scaffolding. 
Where I wanted to change things I have, but without a good reason I wont attempt to "fix" what's not broken.

Ive enjoyed making quite a few style changes and getting the pdf and csv functionality working!

This project is running on an older version of visual studio. with older dependancies. 
Given the oppertunity to make that choice again I would use the lastest reliable tools.

Without further ado enjoy!
